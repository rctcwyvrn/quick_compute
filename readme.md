Python is just too slow for CTF challenges ya know. Especially crypto bruteforce challenges

But libraries like pwnlib and the language itself make it a great imperative shell around something a bit faster. 
  
This is my bit of code that I'll reach for when I hit those CTF challenges with computationally heavy bruteforce so I can easily use my existing python data processing and put the hot loop in rust
